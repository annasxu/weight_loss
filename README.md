# weight_loss
This analysis seeks to identify which factors affect middle-aged people’s successful long term weight loss; impulsivity, amount of daily meditation, whether or not the subject kept a food diary, marital status, weight loss goal, and age are considered. Implementing a logistic regression on the dataset, the final model of significant predictors included age, impulsivity, weight loss goal, amount of meditation, and the interactions among age and amount of meditation, impulsivity and amount of meditation, and weight loss goal and impulsivity. Of these factors, higher weight loss goals, low impulsivity, and meditating a medium amount per day all contributed positively to weight loss. For all ages in this “middle-aged” category, meditating a low or medium amount per day also contributed positively to weight loss; however, for subjects with low impulsivity, meditating a low or medium amount per day contributed negatively to weight loss.
